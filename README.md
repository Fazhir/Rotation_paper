## ***Genetic analysis of stress hormones in hair of healthy nursery pigs and relationships with backtest responses***

***Lay Summary***

This study investigates the genetic basis of stress hormone levels in hair and their potential to predict responses to non-infectious stressors in young, healthy pigs. Stress hormones, including cortisol (CL), cortisone (CN), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its sulfate (DHEA-S), were measured in hair samples from 863 Landrace x Yorkshire F1 barrows at 40 days old. Heritability estimates for these hormones varied, with CL and DHEA-S showing the highest heritability. Genetic correlations among stress hormones ranged from low to high. Additionally, pigs' innate stress response style was assessed using a backtest, with heritability estimates for backtest responses ranging from 0.26 to 0.57. Significant genetic correlations were found between stress hormone levels and backtest responses, particularly for cortisol. GWAS identified major QTLs for cortisol highlighting candidate genes such as NR3C1, SRA1, and HDAC3, as well as QTL for other stress hormones, their ratios, and backtest responses. These findings suggest that stress hormone levels in hair are heritable and correlate with non-infectious stress responses, offering a non-invasive method to select pigs with better stress resilience in commercial settings.

The animal’s response to a standard non-infectious stressor, the backtest, is a validated assessment of its innate coping style to stress. Hair captures stress hormones that accumulate during physiological responses to several stressors throughout hair growth. This study evaluated the potential of stress hormones to capture information on stress response to non-infectious stressors by estimating genetic and phenotypic correlations between their levels in hair of young healthy pigs with the responses to a standard backtest. Results suggest that stress hormones in hair can also inform the genetic copying style of the pigs to non-infectious stresses such as the routine handling and management practices that would be expected in any commercial setting. This indicates that hair stress hormone levels could potentially be used as a non-invasive and easy-to-measure genetic indicator of stress response that can be used to select for better copying pigs at an early age. This study proposes genomic regions of interest with several candidate markers that could be in LD with the causal variant for cortisol, further directing genomic selection using stress hormones in hair.


***Abstract***

The physiological response  to stress in animals results in the production of stress hormones such as cortisol (CL), cortisone (CN), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its sulfate (DHEA-S), which are incorporated into hair as it grows, providing a cumulative measure of stress response over the hair growth period. This study aimed to estimate genetic parameters for the levels of these stress hormones in hair shaved from the rump of 863 healthy Landrace x Yorkshire F1 barrows at approximately 40 days of age. The pigs were genotyped using a 50K SNP panel and imputed up to 650K. Heritability estimates for log-transformed levels of CL, CN, DHEA, and DHEA-S were 0.33 ± 0.10, 0.07 ± 0.07, 0.00, and 0.30 ± 0.10, respectively. Litter effects explained 16, 9, 10, and 17% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Heritability estimates for hormone ratios ranged from 0.02 to 0.40, with the CL/DHEA-S ratio being the most heritable. Genetic correlations among stress hormones varied from low (0.12 ± 0.24 for CL and DHEA-S) to high (0.96 ± 0.16 for CL and CN).


Pigs in disease-free environments like nucleus farms face non-infectious stressors such as weaning, transportation, and mixing. The innate response style of pigs to these stressors can be evaluated using standard backtest responses, including the number and intensity of vocalizations (VN and VI) and struggles (SN and SI). Heritability estimates for these responses ranged from 0.26 ± 0.06 (VI) to 0.57 ± 0.08 (VN), with small litter effects (up to 0.04). Genetic correlation estimates among backtest responses ranged from 0.60 ± 0.13 for SI-VN to 0.99 ± 0.09 for SN-SI. Genetic correlations between stress hormone levels and backtest responses ranged from 0.01 to 0.58, with cortisol showing the highest correlations with backtest responses. A univariate GWAS identified a major QTL for cortisol levels on SSC2, which explained 45.3% of the genetic variance for cortisol and 1.2% for the CL/DHEA-S ratio. Candidate genes in a 5 Mb region around this QTL included the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), SRA1, and HDAC3 genes. The QTL effect was captured by two significant SNPs that were low LD and that, together, accounted for the QTL effect. Imputing SNP genotypes to the whole genome sequence revealed a significant imputed SNP that accounted for the full effect of the QTL. This SNP was in high LD with multiple other imputed SNPs in the region, making it impossible to identify the causal variant. Several other QTL were identified that explained between 1.5 to 12.4% of the genetic variance for DHEA-S, CL/DHEA-S, VI, and VN, as well as pleiotropic QTL for both CL-CN and CL-VN, for CN-VN, and VN-DHEA-S. For regions that did not reach significance according to GWAS, gene set enrichment analyses showed that windows that were associated with the glucocorticoids were enriched for biological processes which resulted in production of more body energy and suppressing inflammatory response. Windows associated with DHEA-S levels were enriched for ontology terms related to immunity activation, gene transcriptional regulation, and silencing through miRNA and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism while those associated with all the backtest responses were enriched for terms related to acute stress response involving dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and their receptors, as well as energy metabolism and locomotive behavior.

Results from this study indicate that stress hormone levels in the hair of young healthy pigs are heritable molecular phenotypes. The significant genetic correlations with backtest responses suggest that these hormone levels can inform about the innate response style of young pigs to non-infectious stressors. This information can facilitate the selection of young pigs that cope better with stress using a non-invasive approach, suitable for recording in disease-free environments such as nucleus farms

***Introduction***

Pork production, the second most-consumed meat in the US and the most consumed globally, is facing increasing demand due to a growing global population. This demand necessitates technological innovations to sustainably increase intensive production. The pork industry is primarily challenged by issues related to animal welfare and various stressors encountered throughout  the production chain, including infectious stressors, such as diseases, and non-infectious stressors, such as weaning, transportation, social interactions, human handling, heat or cold, etc. Stress has been shown to compromise productivity, inhibit growth, and stimulate inflammatory response pathways [[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432000000804), [2](https://doi.org/10.2527/2005.831216x)] Dobson & Smith, 2000; Prunier et al., 2005; Li et al., 2017; Gimsa et al., 2018; Rohleder, 2019), resulting in complex and multifaced changes in the animals. Although response to these stressors is partly determined by genetics and could be improved through genetic selection, the current genetic improvement pyramid aims to keep the nucleus and multiplication herds disease-free, preventing direct measurement of variation in disease response among animals.

Previous research has identified indicator traits on young healthy pigs (i.e., in the nucleus herd) that are predictive of disease resilience through transcriptomics (Lim et al., 2023), proteomics (Chen et al., 2023), and other omics data from the Natural Disease Challenge Model (Putz et al., 2019; Cheng et al., 2020). Disease resilience in these studies is defined as a combination of disease tolerance and disease resistance. When combined with resilience to non-infectious stressors, this can be termed “general resilience.” The host's response to disease primarily involves the immune system. However, stress and immune responses are closely interrelated. Stress response includes physiological adjustments in stress hormones, such as glucocorticoids (cortisol and cortisone), which are the final hormonal effectors of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Tsigos et al., 2020), as well as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S), which are anabolic steroids with regenerative roles that are antagonistic to cortisol (Hechter et al., 1997; Theorell, 2008; Maninger et al., 2009).

Although the mechanism is unclear, stress hormones become incorporated into hair as it grows through various hypothesized processes (Russell et al., 2015; Steudte-Schmiedgen et al., 2016; Burnard et al., 2016). The concentration of these hormones in hair reflects an integrated index of HPA axis activity, offering a retrospective assessment of stress response over weeks or months (Russell et al., 2012; Stalder and Kirschbaum, 2012). This makes hair an attractive tissue for measuring cumulative stress responses in pigs during hair growth. Additionally, hair, as a tissue, is easy to collect store and transport, and hair collection is a non-invasive approach that can be conducted on large numbers of animals on commercial farms (or in nucleus herds). The hypothesis is that these molecules incorporated into hair can provide information on stress responses to non-infectious stressors faced by the pig during the hair growth period.

The backtest is a standard, validated technique for assessing an animal’s innate response (or coping style) to non-infectious stressors by which animals may be classed as active or passive responders to the stress (Hessing et al., 1993); Bunter & Lansdowne, 2004; and Melotti et al. 2011). During the backtest, recorded responses may include time taken for the pig to vocalize, the number and intensity of vocalizations and escape attempts or struggles (Bunter & Lansdowne, 2004). Given this background, the first objective of study was to investigate the genetic basis of stress hormone levels in hair of young healthy pigs. The second objective was to validate their potential to inform on the pigs’ response to non-infectious stressors by estimating genetic and phenotypic correlations between hormone levels in hair and responses to a standard non-infectious stressor, the backtest. The results can support the genomic selection of pigs that cope better with non-infectious stressors in commercial settings, aimed at optimizing production, productivity, and reducing the generation interval for genetic improvements.
